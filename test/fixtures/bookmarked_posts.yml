        doesnt know how to make things better........ twin soul connection which some
        dont understand felt unloved since was a little girl and never fully believe
        people like me.. any hint that someone is being strange with me and i get
        easily upset.. im very sensitive and just want to be happy.... also have abandonment
        issues.. also wanted to write here that I don''t feel people ever like me
        enough or are going to like me so I sometimes get very upset if anyone acts
        wierd with me or I think they are being off with me. I think part of me just
        feels like people are going to not be very nice to me or treat me like im
        annoying and i''m not sure where that feeling comes from. I also feel like
        I''m way too sensitive and can get easily upset about things aswell. I can
        get insecure sometimes about friendships but when I say I care about someone
        i mean it. I also like animals, I love cats and talk to them sometimes.\r\n\r\nhave
        a few interests including yoga, japanese anime, and listening to music, sometimes
        listen to radio 4, knitting and writing poetry.\r\n\r\ncry more than i used

        I try to stick to. Love. Laugh. Live. I came out of an emotionally and physically
        abusive relationship in May, I''d like a nice girl, not a she demon who doesn''t
        let me see my sister or friends. Trying to be a better person each and every
        day, I am caring, just get a little lost sometimes. I have paranoia, in fact
        it''s so bad I''m probably thinking you are thinking ''what a tool'' right
        now. Maybe I am a tool, we all need tools. This is what I mean, I waffle,
        it''s shameful. Talk to me if this rant hasn''t scared you. Truth is Elefriends
        means you can be ''You'' as long as you don''t trigger or offend others. I
        care, we care. Let''s talk and get some community spirit going. The real world
        is largely messed up with the human virus, Elefriends is like a utopia in
        the cacophony of madness. I play guitar, I love music more than anything else
        in life. I would love life to have a soundtrack, it would keep me going and
        keep me strong. I write poetry as that helps too, this is a poem I wrote to
        help myself and others trying to beat depression, it hopefully can reach out
        so some, not being pretentious generally trying to help. Black Dog. \r\nSearching
        for a utopia in the cacophony of madness,\r\nLonging for an answer not just
        ongoing sadness,\r\nOver-think, Procrastinate, it Resonates within me.\r\nVapid
        black dog has a hold of me, but I’m not alone and his bite is tenuous,\r\nRavenous
        paranoia, Insidious to its very core,\r\nShe makes me feel just three inches
        tall.\r\nUnwelcome thoughts, clip my tattered wings.\r\nIcarus complex, venture
        close to our ever conspiring sun,\r\nMalevolent star consumes me like those
        beautiful girls.\r\nWorth more than what you have taken, abusive, controlling.\r\nMisfiring
        axons, a monophyletic taxon,\r\nImpossible I know, to fall in reverse on the
        blackest of black ice.\r\nSister serotonin, biomedical products stop me from
        moaning,\r\nTake the dose and kill the pain,\r\nRemove this jagged glass shattered
        in my brain.\r\nDebilitated, tired of black dogged caustic corruption dissolving
        the fun,\r\nSeeking atonement in this dragged out attritional, invisible war.\r\nRefuse
        to back down or hurt those I love anymore, biting words dissipate, ambition
        radiates,\r\nNever think too deeply of those which pretend to care, \r\nPoisonous,
        callous words ran through my veins, others afraid to approach you,\r\nYou’re
        not a freak and a prejudice stigma can’t deter the complexity of your very
        being.\r\nNarcissistic black dog, you can be restrained,\r\nNihilistic black
        dog, I’m still human,\r\nSuch a general term for a vast range of emotion,\r\nLearning
        how to treat our paradoxical afflictions,\r\nUsted No Va A Ganar.\r\nPeace
        out \u0026 be real. In real life I''m considered weird as I think too deeply
        about things but on here I can be what I''ve always truly meant to be, myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n","email":"taylorpaul.8604@yahoo.co.uk","created_at":"2014-06-16T17:02:29.000Z","profile_image":"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMjAvMTIvNDIvNDMvMjY3L2ltYWdlLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiODB4ODAjIl1d?sha=b504bc92ba08856f","twitter_screen_name":null,"deleted":true,"suspended":true},"recent_interactions":[{"id":2225980,"user_id":13408,"created_at":"2014-08-03T10:31:50.000Z","updated_at":"2014-08-03T10:31:50.000Z","type":"thinking","likes":null,"hears":null,"thinkings":null,"text":null,"post_id":null,"auto_moderated":null,"removed":null,"can_delete":true,"user":{"id":13408,"nickname":"RainbowOfChaos(LittleRachy)","first_name":"Anon","last_name":"Anonymous","bio":"Hey

        arms. She promised herself she wouldn''t let this happen again, she wouldn''t
        let another person in but he''s gotten through her walls he may not believe
        it but he has. Her armour is broken, she feels like she needs to run and scream.
        She shouldn''t let him this close to her she''ll only get hurt again because
        that''s what everyone does to her, they brake her and leave her. She knows
        the feeling all to well, the feeling of hopeless emptiness. A shell of her
        former self. As a kid she was bubbly care free, always the first to introduce
        herself but know she hides in the shadows scared to get hurt. She looks at
        the scars on wrist feeling the urge run through her vains but know she can''t
        do it again, it hurts the people around her and it starts the cycle again.
        In her head she hears the voice tell her she''s not worth it, know one actually
        care what she does to herself, its the same voice that haunts her dreams,
        the same voice that was there when she tried to kill herself. She tries to
        ignore him but he gets louder, her head starts to throb and hands start to
        shake but the man she loves is sat next to her and she makes the promise to
        herself she won''t touch that knife again. She call hear it calling, its been
        months since she used it. She think of the release  it used to give her, the
        pleasure it gave her in the moment but she also remembers the pain after she''s
        done it, the shame she feels when she has to cover her arm so people don''t
        see it, so that they won''t judge her. She can''t stand the eyes on her the
        looks people give her. She feels empty again but won''t let herself cry because
        if she does she admits defeat again and she won''t go back to that. She fought
        to hard to get where she is today and to be the person she is today so because
        of that she will forgive him for what he has done to her. She will show him
        she loves him and does not want to lose him because he has become her world,
        her rock her man.","created_at":"2014-08-03T01:10:10.000Z","updated_at":"2014-08-03T12:42:28.000Z","user_id":11362,"target_id":null,"target_type":"","video_url":"","video_title":null,"video_description":null,"file_uid":null,"file_name":null,"has_image":false,"image_large_url":null,"image_medium_url":null,"sticky":false,"comments_count":1,"link_url":null,"link_title":null,"link_description":null,"likes":{"count":0,"user_like_id":null},"hears":{"count":0,"user_like_id":null},"thinkings":{"count":4,"user_like_id":null},"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"moderator_wall":false,"auto_moderated":false,"video_youtube":false,"removed":true,"removed_by_name":"Cherrelle

        passing I didn''t show much emotion due to being in shock and feeling numb
        also I felt I had to be strong for mum and my brother. My nan and my mothers

        is it....\r\nAfter a long battle on my own, my struggles were finally tied
        together and given a name, on 17th February this year 2014 it was revealed
        that i was battling Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder alongside Recurring
        Depressive Disorder. I struggle to accept this alongside the  impulsiveness
        \u0026 intrusive thoughts. I am a sufferer of many demons and took on Self
        Harming as a way to cope with my rapid emotions and thoughts which has left
        permanent scarring and ive had stitches before. I have been a sufferer of
        severe panic attacks which has ended in me being taken to hospital via ambulance,
        i suffer with bad anxiety and all the horrible symptoms, i hardly leave my
        room or the house anymore, i live in supported accomodation and people who
        live here arent always kind which makes it tough. I was diagnosed at the age
        of 14 with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome which is painful (which i take Co-Codamol
        for) to go alongside my mental illnesses. I waited years to seek help, i had
        first become suicidal and attempted self harm at the age of 11 after bullying
        which resulted in me being pulled out from school everyday but in the end
        it stopped when i was 12 until i was 15 and it started again in college, i
        quit after my 3rd year after being bullied by the staff and students which
        led to my first suicide attempt at age 18. I have episodes of Dissociation,
        which i''m told is a coping strategy. I have experienced this since a child,
        I thought that this happens to everybody and that this was normal, but apparently
        not. I am currently on many medications including Mirtazapine 45mg, Quetiapine
        600mg plus an extra 50mg spread throughout the day, Promethazine 50mg, buscopan
        for IBD and renitidine 300mg as the meds may be damaging my stomach lining
        causing a lot of painful symptoms, this combination of meds seem to be helping
        now, previously i have tried Citalopram, Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine 137.5mg (it
        made me angry and aggressive, i came straight off it) and been on Carbamazepine
        400mg, Half Inderal LA 80mg (Beta Blockers) plus Diazepam, propranolol 10mg,
        Omeprazole 20mg also Olanzapine and lorazepam none of these in the past have
        helped to control my moods, self harming, intrusive thoughts and thoughts
        of suicide, despite me keep going to the doctors they don''t care. I have
        over dosed 10 times since April 18th ''13 aged 18 until now aged 20, i have
        been in 72 hr voluntary hospitalisation on a psychiatric ward 5 times this
        year so far and 2 five day admissions for my mental health and one occasion
        for a severe panic attack, 4 months apart of eachother, ive had to mental
        health act assessments in 1 week, been to 4 different hospitals, transferred
        via ambulance to hospitals an hour away from my friends or family, i did meet
        some lovely people and engaged in some therapies. I''ve had the police force
        me to hospital and paramedics called on me twice in a month and 2 more in
        the space of a week recently, I''ve been to a\u0026e 10 times so far and been
        with the Crisis Team twice in 4 months apart from eachother for a couple of
        weeks. Ive had many ''friendships'' which mostly involved me regularly being
        punched in the face, slapped round the face, punched in the stomach, been
        strangled, punched twice in the widpipe and throat, people attempting to try
        and rip my earrings out for fun after i just had them done and had my stuff
        damaged plus so much more. Ive been forced to hospitals by police, been 136
        under the polices section, held in custody twice, had everything taken from
        me and completely stripped of my clothes and shoved in prison clothes like
        a criminal, i have been very damaged by this and suffer daily flashbacks.
        I like my own company on good days but everyone needs someone despite having
        trust issues. I''ve been mentally abused through the majority of my life,
        been blamed for everything, bullied about my weight, blamed for making my
        mum sick with a neurological illness and pushed down to the lowest places.
        So pretty much people bully me and hurt me mentally and physically all the
        time, you never get used to it or forget it. I have also sadly have the sufferer
        of Sexual assault and Domestic abuse psychologically by the man i thought
        i couldn''t live without, he didn''t love me, he loved the pain he cause and
        controlled every inch of my life, he''s tried blaming my mental health and
        used horrible things against me forcing me to do things to me and him that
        i didn''t want to do. I''ve been a sufferer of Psychotic symptoms in the past
        that i was told was due to extreme stress and thankfully not full blown psychosis.
        I only get these now if i''m going through a really tough episode, i don''t
        get the symptoms very often now but when they are there they are frightening.

        put this picture up to remind myself that I used to find joy in the smallest
        things. Before my breakdown, two and a half years ago, my working life was
        as frightening as a runaway train... I was the Training Manager for 2,500
        staff and also a Lecturer in Teacher Training! I was derailed... thrown past
        the point of no return and buried in the magnitude of 3 big college mergers
        which birthed a ''super college''. I became broken... It''s hard to describe
        a complete breakdown and the gradual unravelling of a grown woman. My brain
        and responses disintegrated over time and I backed away from everything until
        I fell off the cliff into a deep abyss. I locked myself away completely, apart
        from emerging to be with close family ....and eventually, Elefriends.  Ultimately,
        I had to retire early, due to ill health. I''ve always been shy but I''m even
        more introverted and quiet now.... However, I remain a loving Mum (I have
        a  daughter and a son :), a devoted Nanna to Emily (age 4 ;) and a trusted
        friend. Severe anxiety and panic attacks, accompanied by bouts of depression,
        are now a part of my life and sometimes I am overwhelmed.... BUT I found Elefriends
        and it''s helped me :) I''ve gained wonderful,  understanding friends and
        endless support, which I aim to return! \r\nI still try to live up to this
        belief: \"Live simply, love generously, care deeply, speak kindly, be grateful,
        laugh lots and leave the rest to God.\" \r\n❤  I LOVE; poppies, they always
        lift my spirit... ❤ Living by the sea in North Wales, ❤ Tiffany lamps ❤  Tuscany
