        I have been accepted for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy to help me get through
        the everyday stresses and worries I have. I am hoping that when it soon begins
        I can change my entire way of thinking. I believe that this has been an ongoing
        problem for many years and has resulted in me feeling very miserable and anti-social.\r\nI
        know I can be a caring, loving and loyal person and I have used the arts of
        felting, knitting, toy making, sculptures and painting to strength my way
        of expressing myself but yet I very quickly change to have no self-esteem
        and kick myself down constantly. \r\nIt effects my work life, how I am socially,
        all my relationships and my general way of pursuing a happy life.\r\nThrough
        help and comfort from everyone who may care, I can only hope that I can be
        a good provider of support for all you lovely human beings who need it also.","email":"hayzcourt@hotmail.co.uk","created_at":"2015-03-01T17:57:02.000Z","profile_image":"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDMvMDEvMTgvMjEvMzIvMTE2LzE0NTA4NDBfMTAxNTI3OTAwODMxMTEwMzBfOTE5ODQwMzUyNDg2MTA0OTQzNV9uLmpwZWciXV0?sha=db7e9583e6607624"},{"id":25877,"nickname":"Jinjanut","first_name":"Sangeeta","last_name":"Dahri","bio":"I
